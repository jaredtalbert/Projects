template = "My dad's advice to me when I was a blank boy, around blank years old.\n\nSon, I want you to know what I really think of you. You are blank. When you were first born and I stared into your blank blank blank I knew right then that you would make me blank. It's a big blank world out there and there will come a time when I wont be here anymore. You must take life's issues blank steps at a time. Make sure you blank your homework, be blank to others, take care of your blank, buy a nice blank blank first before blank a brand new one, obey your blank and handle peer pressure the blank way possible. Don't blank, say blank to blank, don't blank and drive, find a blank girl to call your own, be blank to her and son never give up your blank. Stay true to yourself and go for what you blank. I know you want to become a blank some day, make me blank ! I love you son. -Dad\n\nThis is the blank piece of advice I've ever gotten. I hope it helps you too !"
